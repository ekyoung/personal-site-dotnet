# This is an upstart (http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) script
# to run the node.js server on system boot and make it
# manageable with commands such as
# 'start node-app' and 'stop node-app'
#
# This script is to be placed in /etc/init to work with upstart.
#
# Internally the 'initctl' command is used to manage:
# initctl help
# initctl status node-app
# initctl reload node-app
# initctl start node-app
